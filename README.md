# Wanna Hear Your Voice: Adaptive, Effective, and Language-Agnostic Approach in Voice Extraction

![Architecture](architecture.png)

## Introduction

**Wanna Hear Your Voice (WHYV)** is a novel, language-agnostic approach to Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) that adapts effectively across languages without the need for fine-tuning. This project addresses the challenge of transferring TSE models from one language to another while maintaining high performance.

The research focuses on modeling mixtures and reference speech, proposing a unique **gating mechanism** that modifies specific frequencies based on the speakerâ€™s acoustic features. WHYV outperforms other models in adapting to different languages, achieving:

- **SI-SDR**: 17.3544 on clean English speech
- **SI-SDR**: 13.2032 on English speech mixed with Wham! noise

## Key Features

- **Language-Agnostic**: No fine-tuning required across languages.
- **Frequency Modulation**: Gating mechanism for adjusting specific frequencies.
- **High Performance**: Superior SI-SDR scores across languages and noise conditions.

## Demos

Explore the WHYV model in action through the following demos:

- **Vietnamese Conversation**: Hear the separation in Vietnamese speech.
- **Korean & English Mixed**: Experience language-agnostic separation with mixed languages.
- **English Mix (No Noise)**: High clarity in clean speech.
- **English Mix (With Noise)**: Extract the target speaker from noisy environments.
- **Multilanguage Mix**: Robust performance with multiple languages.
